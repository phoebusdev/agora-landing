        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Proxies exist because observation was expensive.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">Degrees, interviews, years of experience—all proxies for capability we couldn't directly measure. With AI-augmented observation, we can watch the work happen. Proxies become obsolete.</p>

      <h2 id="problem-heading">The Problem</h2>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <p>Humans relied on proxies because <strong>direct observation doesn't scale</strong>. You can't watch a thousand candidates code. You can't observe their problem-solving across diverse scenarios. So we invented shortcuts: degrees signal perseverance, years of experience signal exposure, interviews signal communication.</p>

        <p>These proxies were pragmatic compromises, not fundamental truths:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Credentials</strong> predict capability weakly (r≈0.3) but were cheap to verify</li>
          <li><strong>Interviews</strong> measure performance anxiety more than job competence</li>
          <li><strong>Years of experience</strong> confound time served with skill gained</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The constraint was observation capacity, not what we actually wanted to measure. We knew proxies were imperfect—we had no alternative.</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <p><strong>With AI, proxies become liabilities.</strong> When you can directly observe work quality at scale, filtering by credentials actively harms you. You're optimizing for signals that were always weak predictors, now ignoring the strong signal AI makes accessible: actual delivery.</p>

        <p>Agora removes the proxy layer entirely. Anonymous submission means you cannot filter by credentials—only by delivered work. AI-assisted specification matching means you can evaluate thousands of submissions directly. Instead of asking "what kind of person should do X," the platform answers "what are the actual requirements for X to be done."</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="solution" aria-labelledby="solution-heading">
      <h2 id="solution-heading">The Solution</h2>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <p>Agora forces direct observation by making proxies architecturally unavailable. Four structural constraints ensure you cannot evaluate based on who people are—only on what they deliver.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <h3>1. Anonymity by Default</h3>
        <p>No names, credentials, or identity markers. Only verified delivery history and public work samples. This forces observation of the work itself—you literally cannot filter by proxies because they don't exist in the system.</p>

        <p><strong>Why it's necessary</strong>: Humans default to proxies when available. Anonymity removes the shortcut, forcing you to observe what actually matters: can they deliver?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <h3>2. Escrow Protection</h3>
        <p>Payment locked before work starts. Release requires specification compliance, enforced through smart contracts or cryptographic proofs. Both parties commit before knowing each other's identity.</p>

        <p><strong>Why it's necessary</strong>: Without institutional trust (brand reputation, employment contracts), trust must be cryptographic. Escrow makes delivery economically rational regardless of identity.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <h3>3. Public Transaction History</h3>
        <p>Every delivery recorded permanently: specification, submission, acceptance/rejection, dispute resolution. This generates data on what actually works—not what credentials predict should work.</p>

        <p><strong>Why it's necessary</strong>: Resumes claim "3 years Python experience." Transaction history shows: delivered 47 projects, 91% acceptance rate, avg complexity score 7.2. One is verifiable, the other isn't. AI can pattern-match across thousands of actual outcomes rather than inferring from proxies.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <h3>4. Specification Discipline</h3>
        <p>Clear acceptance criteria required before posting. Disputes resolved by specification compliance, not subjective preference. This shifts focus from "who should do this" to "what exactly needs to be done."</p>

        <p><strong>Why it's necessary</strong>: Vague requirements invite proxy-based filtering ("hire someone who seems like they'd understand what we want"). Precise specifications make capability directly observable: either the work meets criteria or it doesn't. AI-assisted spec generation makes this practical at scale.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <p style="margin-top: var(--space-xl); padding: var(--space-lg); background-color: var(--color-bg-secondary); border-left: 4px solid var(--color-gray-600); border-radius: var(--radius-sm);"><strong>The Platform Generates Insight on What Actually Works</strong><br><br>Every transaction creates data: specification → submission → acceptance/rejection. With thousands of transactions, patterns emerge. What specification features correlate with successful delivery? What complexity thresholds predict disputes? What acceptance criteria are too vague? The platform doesn't just facilitate work—it refines our understanding of requirements themselves. Instead of clumsily seeking "the kind of person who should do X," we directly ascertain what X actually requires.</p>

    <section id="feasibility" aria-labelledby="feasibility-heading">
      <h2 id="feasibility-heading">Feasibility</h2>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <p>Building Agora requires solving four major technical challenges. This section addresses each challenge directly, explaining the tradeoffs and why reasonable approaches exist despite implementation uncertainty.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <h3>1. Payment Architecture</h3>
        <p><strong>The Challenge</strong>: Escrow requires holding funds securely and releasing them based on contract fulfillment. Traditional approaches use centralized payment processors (Stripe, PayPal) which add friction and fees. Blockchain smart contracts offer trustless escrow but introduce complexity and gas fees.</p>

        <p><strong>The Approach</strong>: Start with centralized escrow (Stripe Connect or similar) for MVP simplicity, with architecture designed to support smart contract migration later. The key insight: <em>the escrow mechanism is implementation-agnostic</em>. Whether funds are held by Stripe or an Ethereum smart contract, the user experience is identical—poster deposits funds, worker completes work, funds release upon acceptance.</p>

        <p><strong>Tradeoff</strong>: Centralized escrow requires trusting the platform operator initially. This is acceptable for MVP validation (50-100 early adopters) but would require decentralization for scale. The architecture supports this migration path.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <h3>2. Cold Start Problem</h3>
        <p><strong>The Challenge</strong>: Marketplaces need both supply (workers) and demand (projects) to function. Without projects, workers won't join. Without workers, posters won't create projects.</p>

        <p><strong>The Approach</strong>: Multiple viable strategies exist:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Seed content</strong>: Founder posts 10-20 real projects with actual payment to demonstrate platform viability and create initial transaction history</li>
          <li><strong>Single community focus</strong>: Launch within a specific technical community (e.g., Rust developers, technical writers) where both supply and demand exist</li>
          <li><strong>Worker-first</strong>: Build portfolio/reputation tools first, let workers create profiles before projects exist, then recruit posters to this pre-qualified pool</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Assessment</strong>: The cold start problem is real but not unique. Every marketplace solves this. The anonymity constraint actually <em>helps</em> here—workers can build reputation without revealing identity, lowering the barrier to creating profiles.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <h3>3. Moderation and Abuse</h3>
        <p><strong>The Challenge</strong>: Anonymous platforms enable abuse (spam, fraud, harassment) since users can create unlimited sockpuppet accounts. Traditional solutions rely on identity verification, which contradicts Agora's anonymity principle.</p>

        <p><strong>The Approach</strong>: Algorithmic reputation combined with economic disincentives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Deposit requirements</strong>: New accounts must complete small paid tasks before posting projects (skin in the game)</li>
          <li><strong>Transaction history</strong>: Accounts with zero completions have lower visibility than accounts with verified work</li>
          <li><strong>Dispute resolution</strong>: Public arbitration with both parties' transaction histories visible to adjudicators</li>
          <li><strong>Human intervention</strong>: When algorithmic signals flag potential abuse, human moderators review (without seeing identity)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Tension</strong>: Pure algorithmic governance is appealing but insufficient. Some human judgment is necessary for edge cases. The key is ensuring moderators make decisions based on <em>behavior patterns</em> (repeated disputes, specification gaming) rather than identity attributes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <h3>4. Legal and Regulatory</h3>
        <p><strong>The Challenge</strong>: Platforms facilitating paid work face employment law questions (contractor vs employee classification), payment regulations (money transmission licenses), and tax reporting requirements (1099 forms in US).</p>

        <p><strong>The Approach</strong>: Structure as marketplace, not employer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contractor model</strong>: All work is project-based with clear specifications, making worker classification clearer (though not eliminating risk)</li>
          <li><strong>Payment processor partnership</strong>: Use existing licensed processors (Stripe) rather than becoming a money transmitter</li>
          <li><strong>Tax jurisdiction</strong>: Start in favorable jurisdictions (Delaware C-corp for US operations) with counsel specialized in gig economy platforms</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance-first design</strong>: Build audit trails, transaction records, and dispute documentation from day one</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Reality Check</strong>: Legal risk cannot be eliminated, only managed. Upwork, Fiverr, and Toptal all navigate these issues. Agora's anonymity adds complexity but doesn't create fundamentally new legal questions—it's still a marketplace connecting clients with contractors.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <p style="margin-top: var(--space-xl); padding: var(--space-lg); background-color: var(--color-bg-secondary); border-left: 4px solid var(--color-gray-600); border-radius: var(--radius-sm);"><strong>Confidence in Architecture, Uncertainty in Implementation</strong><br><br>These challenges are real and non-trivial. But none are fundamental blockers—they're implementation details that require careful engineering and legal counsel. The core architectural insight (evaluate capability directly, remove proxy data) remains sound regardless of how escrow is implemented or how the cold start problem is solved. Agora isn't betting that these problems are easy. It's betting that they're solvable given the efficiency gains from eliminating the proxy layer.</p>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <h3>MVP Scope (6 Months)</h3>
        <p><strong>What's Included</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Core posting flow</strong>: Create project with specification, acceptance criteria, payment amount, deadline</li>
          <li><strong>Core worker flow</strong>: Browse projects, submit work, receive payment via escrow</li>
          <li><strong>Anonymous profiles</strong>: Transaction history visible, credentials hidden</li>
          <li><strong>Basic escrow</strong>: Centralized (Stripe Connect), funds released on acceptance or after dispute resolution</li>
          <li><strong>Specification evolution</strong>: Public Q&A forum for clarifying requirements before acceptance</li>
          <li><strong>Simple reputation</strong>: Count of completed projects, dispute rate, average project value</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What's Excluded</strong> (explicitly punted to post-MVP):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Smart contract escrow (use centralized)</li>
          <li>Advanced reputation algorithms (use simple counts)</li>
          <li>Mobile apps (web-only)</li>
          <li>Team/organization accounts (individual only)</li>
          <li>Recurring contracts (one-time projects only)</li>
          <li>Messaging (public forum only, no private DMs)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Target</strong>: 10 posted projects with 5+ completions within 6 months. This validates that real work can happen on the platform and real reputation can accumulate.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <h3>Success Metrics</h3>
        <p>MVP is considered successful if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>10+ projects posted</strong> with real payment (not test transactions)</li>
          <li><strong>5+ projects completed</strong> with work delivered and payment released</li>
          <li><strong>Zero disputes escalated</strong> beyond platform arbitration (early signal of specification quality)</li>
          <li><strong>3+ workers with 2+ completions</strong> (reputation is accumulating)</li>
          <li><strong>Poster repeat rate >30%</strong> (posters return to create second project)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These metrics validate the core hypothesis: <strong>capability-based evaluation via verified work completion is viable</strong>. If projects are posted, work is completed, and reputation accumulates, the fundamental mechanism works.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <h3>Future Vision (Post-MVP)</h3>
        <p><strong>If MVP succeeds</strong>, potential expansions include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Smart contract escrow</strong>: Migrate to Ethereum/Polygon for trustless payments (contingent on gas fees being acceptable)</li>
          <li><strong>Reputation algorithms</strong>: Weight completions by project complexity, adjust for dispute resolution outcomes, factor in specification quality</li>
          <li><strong>Category expansion</strong>: Beyond software development to design, writing, research, data analysis</li>
          <li><strong>Team contracts</strong>: Allow multiple workers to collaborate on larger projects</li>
          <li><strong>Recurring relationships</strong>: Workers can accept ongoing retainer arrangements with posters they've worked with successfully</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Critical constraint</strong>: All expansions must preserve the core architectural principles (anonymity, escrow, transaction history, specification discipline). Features that reintroduce proxy-based evaluation are rejected regardless of user demand.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block type-text">
        <h3>Resource Requirements</h3>
        <p><strong>Technical Cofounder Needed</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skills</strong>: Full-stack web development (backend + frontend), payment integration experience, database design</li>
          <li><strong>Commitment</strong>: 6-month MVP build, part-time (20hrs/week) acceptable initially</li>
          <li><strong>Equity</strong>: 30-40% cofounder stake, vesting over 4 years</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Funding</strong>: Fellowship support ($100k) covers 6-month runway for two founders. Additional seed funding ($300k-500k) would accelerate timeline but not required for MVP validation.</p>
